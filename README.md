# Habit project

This project allows to track and manage your habits. User is able to add new habits to the calendar, mark that it was completed as well as remove existing habits, or even rename them by double clicking on the habit name.
Navigate through days by pressing butons on the sides, or by typing in a date in the URL. 

Available dates are a year in the past and the future from current day, so for example you can enter /day/2023-11-13 and it would bring you to that specific day.
